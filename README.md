# Phishing Detection System

## Overview
This repository contains a phishing detection system powered by Artificial Intelligence. The project aims to identify potential phishing emails based on their content. By leveraging machine learning models, we provide an efficient solution to detect malicious emails and maintain a database of potentially dangerous senders.

## Features
1. **Model Comparison**: We evaluated the performance of three different machine learning models on the dataset `Phishing_Email.csv` from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails/data). The evaluated models were:
   - `ealvaradob/bert-finetuned-phishing`
   - `cybersectony/phishing-email-detection-distilbert_v2.4.1`
   - `imanoop7/bert-phishing-detector`

   The evaluation metrics included:
   - Recall
   - Accuracy
   - F1-score

   Based on these results, the most effective model was `cybersectony/phishing-email-detection-distilbert_v2.4.1`, which was selected for deployment.

2. **Django Web Application**:
   - Users can input an email's content and sender information through a web-based form.
   - The application scans the email for phishing indicators using the selected AI model.
   - If the email is identified as phishing, the sender is added to a database of potentially dangerous entities.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation, `Phishing_Email.csv`, is publicly available on Kaggle. It includes various features extracted from phishing and legitimate emails to train the models effectively.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/phishing-detection.git
   cd phishing-detection
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   **Note for macOS users**: If you encounter issues with pywin32, remove the line pywin32==308 from the requirements.txt file before running the above command.

4. Migrate the Django database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Django application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
2. Paste the email content and sender's information into the provided form.
3. Click the **Scan** button to analyze the email.
4. If the email is flagged as phishing, the sender will be added to the database of potentially dangerous entities.

## Model Evaluation
During the initial phase of the project, we tested three machine learning models on the `Phishing_Email.csv` dataset. The evaluated models were:
- `ealvaradob/bert-finetuned-phishing`
- `cybersectony/phishing-email-detection-distilbert_v2.4.1`
- `imanoop7/bert-phishing-detector`

The evaluation process focused on key metrics:
- **Recall**: To measure the ability of the model to detect phishing emails correctly.
- **Accuracy**: To determine the overall correctness of predictions.
- **F1-score**: To balance precision and recall for better decision-making.

The best-performing model was `cybersectony/phishing-email-detection-distilbert_v2.4.1`, which demonstrated the highest effectiveness and was integrated into the Django application.
